At first, Joffrey is kind and polite to Sansa. However, he refuses to show sympathy with the family when Bran Stark falls from a tower, until physically forced to by his uncle, Tyrion Lannister. While on the Kingsroad to King's Landing, Joffrey and Sansa come across Arya Stark practicing swordplay with a commoner Mycah. Joffrey accuses Mycah of assaulting a noble girl and makes a cut on his face with a sword. This causes Arya to hit Joffrey, allowing Mycah to escape. When Joffrey then turns on Arya, her direwolf Nymeria attacks Joffrey, injuring him. Later, Joffrey lies about the attack, saying it was unprovoked and demands Nymeria to be killed; however, Sansa's direwolf Lady is killed instead. He later has his bodyguard Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane hunt down and kill Mycah.\n",

His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing; consequently, he is almost killed during a riot. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, aided by the forces of House Tyrell. To cement the alliance between those families, Joffrey's engagement to Sansa is annulled so he can marry Margaery Tyrell.\n",

It does this by finding relevant text in iteration 1 and including that as context for the question in iteration 2.  It provides both Arya's parents for q1 though, not really answering the question in a straightforward way.  That is because the answer is directly in the text though, and requires no inference.  \n",

    "* Summarization is more useful for summarizing ranked results rather than answering questions or exploring the data.\n",
    "* Extractive QA with BM25 + ranking performed best at answering questions whose answers could be pulled directly out of the text.  Extractive QA with multi-hop semantic search performed well at identifying pieces of information that could be combined to answer complex questions that require inferring info from the text.\n",
    "* Generative QA performed best at answering questions that required making inferences based on the text content when combined with multi-hop semantic search, although that meant not doing well with easy answers that came out of the text.  Generative QA with BM25 + ranking performed well for both types of questions.  \n",
