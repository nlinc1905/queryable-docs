The Russian Defense Ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces have breached the front lines, claiming the military situation remains under control amid speculation of Kyiv's anticipated counteroffensive.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier on Thursday said that his nation requires more time and foreign military aid before such a measure â€” while Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of Russian private military company Wagner Group, said that Ukraine had already begun such a counterattack and were approaching the embattled city of Bakhmut from the flanks.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Hanna Maliar on Friday said that the country's forces have advanced 2 kilometers in the direction of Bakhmut.
